# SHAC
## Swahili HIV/AIDS chatbot - SHAC
This is a simple chatbot that will answer fundamental questions about HIV/AIDS mainly in kiswahili but the data source could be changed and be used for any other needs.

## There multiple files that consist of different implementations 
The following is a brief note on different files 

### dumb_bot.py
This is the first sample bot which dealt with answering questions about chronic kidney ( oops! `:open_mouth:` was for practice)

### swahili_hiv_bot.py
This was the second version which also uses a link as it's data source

### swahili_hiv_bot_v2.py
This bot uses json file as it's data source of which was previously fetched from the web as a pdf then converted to json

### swahili_qna.json
This is the data source for questions and answers
